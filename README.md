# Evil Corn Costume

Source code and audio clip files for my evil corn Halloween costume. I got the idea for this costume from the [Adafruit Electronic Demon Costume Howto](https://youtu.be/8HZFY4Xti7k), and made a few customizations. Instead of an Arduino, I'm using an old Raspberry Pi that I had laying around. I'm also just playing creepy audio files when a button is pressed, instead of synthesizing my voice. Finally, I'm using a creepy corn head mask that I found on Amazon. When it popped up in my search for a mask, I thought, "WTF? This is so ridiculous - it's perfect!"
